      <p class="mb-4">Last updated: June 19, 2025</p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Wallp ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Wallp app ("the Service"), a free wallpaper app that sources images from
        <a href="https://picsum.photos/" class="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank">https://picsum.photos</a>. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone using our Service.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Wallp does not collect any personal identifiable information. We do not request login credentials, nor do we collect data such as your name, email, or device ID.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Log Data</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Whenever you use our Service, we may collect information called Log Data in case of an error in the app. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, and the time and date of your use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The Wallp app uses images from <a href="https://picsum.photos/" class="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank">Picsum</a>, a third-party image provider. We do not control or take responsibility for their privacy policies or practices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Cookies</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Wallp does not use cookies directly. However, the third-party services we rely on (like image APIs) may use cookies to improve their functionality. You may opt to manage or block cookies via your device settings.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Security</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        While we do not collect personal data, we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting any incidental data collected (like crash reports). No method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Your Rights</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Since Wallp does not store user data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. You can uninstall the app at any time to stop all data transmission.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
      </p>
